The function `in_collision` check collosion by create resolution point among link, if the distance from resolution point to sphere's centers  is within sphere's raduis, then this is collision and it return `true`

The function `chack_edge` is creating ticks among different configuration, and will check collision when the robot is moving from one config to another config. By calling `in_collision`, it will return true if there is any collision. 

Potential issue:

- There might be swept value collision between ticks.
- The algorithm will take long time when resolution is high

### c1

Generate random point from config space

Number of samples: 100
Number within bounds: 100
Number in collision: 11

### c2

Implement PRM algorithm to sample 100 points from free config space. The below figure is the adjacency matrix about the distance from sample point to another sample point.

### c3

Implement the PRM algorithm to find the path from approximate start config to approximate goal config with the adjacency matrix from c2. 

Path found with 4 intermediate waypoints:
   -0.0060   -0.3115         0   -0.4864
    0.1855   -0.4584         0   -1.7404
    0.7217   -0.9197         0   -2.2369
    1.1395   -1.6201         0   -2.4837
    0.9109   -2.1409         0   -2.8590
    0.0970   -2.8541         0   -2.8122

### c5

Create another graph to simplfy the path. Those previously non-consecutive pair of point will attempt to be connected in the smoothing algorithm. The new graph denote the reachability of previous non-consecutive pair of point. After running graph finding algorithm again in the new graph, it's averagely simplified to around 3 point.
